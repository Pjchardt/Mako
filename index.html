	<h2>Summon digital spirits</h2>
	<br />
	Three participants enter a digital void between the nodes of our network. Here they summon spirits that reside within the digital realm of data that surrounds us. Participants change the flow of data around them by interfacing with artifacts of an alien civilization that allows different frequencies to resonate in the void and call upon its inhabitants. Using VR headsets and headphones, the participants can witness the spirit world of our devices.
	<br />
	<h2>How it works</h2>
	<br />
	<p>
	Three participants sit in chairs around a table in a triangle formation. Each player wears a GearVR headset and headphones. In front of them on the table is a custom input device with two IR sensors that detect proximity. 
	</p>
	<p>
	The three custom input devices send data to an Arduino which communicates with a Unity application running on a PC, via USB.We use the same code we built last year for Deluxe Turbo Racing 360 to pull Arduino data into Unity. Unity then syncs the data over a local wireless network with the GearVR devices, using the Photon networking library and logic we built for our multiplayer mode in our GearVR game Daydream BLue.
	</p>
	<p>
	Inside the experience, players see each other, represented as faces behind animal masks in a neon outline. Head rotation and voice data is synced over the network, so players feel present together in the space. 3D models of the input devices are placed in the experience in front of the players. They place their hands in front of the sensors and lights illuminate in the space. Once multiple people engage, a band of energy connects everyone together. Players move their hands in front of the sensors to modify the energy band. The energy band calls forth visuals and sounds from the spirit world of data, calling forth different sights and sound based on the participants input.
	</p>
	<p>
	The session lasts 3 minutes. If players are lucky, a spirit is conjured forth for a few seconds before the screen fades to black and the experience is over.
    </p>

	<h2>Hoping to return to Alt.Ctrl.GDC</h2>
	<br />
	Last year while still at Super Soul Shea and I developed Deluze Turbo Racing 360. This year, we are modifying three custom controllers we origininally built for an art installation to hook into Unity and a GearVR application. We will use the tech we wrote for our multiplayer GearVR game Daydream BLue to drive a virtual experience across the VR headsets and temporarly bring participants into the spirit world of data.
