	<h1>Mako</h1>
	<br />
	<h2>Summon digital spirits</h2>
	<br />
	Three participants enter a digital void between the nodes of our network. Here they summon spirits that reside within the digital realm of data that surrounds us. Participants change the flow of data around them by interfacing with artifacts of an alien civilization that allows different frequencies to resonate in the void and call upon its inhabitants. Using VR headsets and headphones, the participants can witness the spirit world of our devices.
	<br />
	<h2>How it works</h2>
	<br />
	<p>
	Three participants sit in chairs around a table in a triangle formation. Each player wears a GearVR headset and headphones. In their lap they hold a custom inout device with two IR sensors that detect proximity. 
	</p>
	<p>
	The three custom input devices send data to an Arduino which communicates with a Unity application running on a PC, via USB.We use the same code we built last year for Deluxe Turbo Racing 360 to pull Arduino data into Unity. Unity then syncs the data over a local wireless network with the GearVR devices, using the Photon networking library and logic we built for our multiplayer mode in our GearVR game Daydream BLue.
	</p>
	<p>
	Inside the experience, players see each other, represented as faces behind animal masks in a neon outline. Head rotation and voice data is synced over the network, so players feel present together in the space. As players interact with their input devices, nodes of light pulse in frotn of them. As players engage, their lights connect into a ring of energy. As the energy ring modulates and shimmers, players modify their sorroundings with their hands, like playing alien instuments. The void comes alive with shapes and sounds, reacting to the players. As the summoning grows in energy, the participants call forth visuals and sounds from the spirit world of the digital realm.
	<p>
	The session lasts 3 minutes. Cuminating in the final moments of intensity before the ritual is complete and the void reverts back to nothingness.

	<h2>Hoping to return to Alt.Ctrl.GDC</h2>
	<br />
	Last year while still at Super Soul Shea and I developed Deluze Turbo Racing 360. This year, we are modifying three custom controllers we origininally built for an art installation to hook into Unity and a GearVR application. We will use the tech we wrote for our multiplayer GearVR game Daydream Blue to drive a virtual experience across the VR headsets.
